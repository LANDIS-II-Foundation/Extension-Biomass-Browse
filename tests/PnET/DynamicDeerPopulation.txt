>> [2009] Mortality rates in the northern region break down to 43 percent due to human hunting, 9 percent starvation, 8 percent poaching, 7 percent coyotes, 6 percent wolves, and 6 percent vehicle collisions. 
>>On average, 73 percent of does and 47 percent of adult bucks in the northern study survived the year. Mean=60% survival, 40% mortality.
