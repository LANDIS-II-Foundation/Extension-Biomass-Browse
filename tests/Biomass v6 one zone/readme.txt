This is a test scenario to help troubleshoot some issues with Biomass Succession and Browse not playing well together. 
Please do not use any of the parameters here to represent real values; it's largely nonsense.
One population zone.
This should work with Landis core v7, Biomass v6.0, Browse v1.1

This one is messed up for some reason
