# What is the Biomass Browse Extension?

The Browse extension is designed to simulate the removal of biomass from tree cohorts by ungulate browsers, the concurrent loss of growth and/or mortality, and optionally the reciprocal feedback between the availability of browse and the population dynamics of the ungulates.

The Browse extension is designed to run with any succession extensions that carry cohort biomass attributes (e.g., Biomass Succession, PnET-Succession, NECN Succession).
